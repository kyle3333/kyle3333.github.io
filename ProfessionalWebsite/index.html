            Hello. My name is Kyle Hassold and I am a Junior in High school. 
            I am currently enrolled in an academy that has me taking many 
            computer science classes in addition to normal high school 
            classes. I am hoping to major in Computer Science, with a possible
            major or minor in Mathematics, in college. I hope to do research 
            related to the fast growing field of Artificial Intelligence as 
            my career. I have experience in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
            SQL, and a little PHP as well as some job experience from an internship 
            I completed over this past summer.
